RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended for smooth 4K streaming)

Storage: 32GB minimum (64GB+ recommended for apps and cache)

Graphics: Integrated graphics sufficient for 1080p; dedicated GPU recommended for 4K

# Compatible Hardware Types

Your setup works on virtually any PC configuration:

Desktop PCs: From full towers to mini-ITX builds

Laptops: Any laptop with HDMI output capability

Mini PCs: Intel NUC, Beelink, ASUS PN series

Older Hardware: Even 10+ year old systems can run effectively with optimization

# Installation Commands:
# Brave Browser (your preference)
```
sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg
sudo apt update && sudo apt install brave-browser

# Alternative: Chromium for better PWA support
sudo apt install chromium-browser

```

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Code block delimiters**: Use triple backticks ``` with `bash` language identifier
2. **Comments**: Use single `#` instead of `*#...*`
3. **URL**: Keep the URL as plain text inside the code block (remove the markdown link formatting `[text](url)`)
4. **Clean formatting**: Remove the asterisks around comments

## Alternative: If you want explanatory text outside the code block:

```
**Brave Browser (your preference)**:
```bash
sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg
sudo apt update && sudo apt install brave-browser
```

**Alternative: Chromium for better PWA support**:
```bash
sudo apt install chromium-browser
```

**Firefox with hardware acceleration**:
